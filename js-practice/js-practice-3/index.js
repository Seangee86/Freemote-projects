/*
    ☑️ create an empty "Array Literal" and save it in the variable "days"
    ☑️ write an "if" statement to test if the array has any items (HINT: truthy / falsy)
    ☑️ inside the "if" block, print out the first item from the array
    ☑️ inside the "else" block, push a string "Mon" into the array
*/

/*
    ☑️ create an "Array Literal" and save it in the variable "months" and add the values "Jan" and "Feb"
    ☑️ write an "if" statement to test if the array has any items AND the first month starts with "J" 
    ☑️ inside the "if" block, print out the first item from the array
    ☑️ inside the "else" block, push a string "Jan" into the array.
    ☑️ outside the "if else" blocks, print out the "type of" the "months" variable (HINT: arrays have a special type function)
*/

/*
    ☑️ create a variable "numOfWeeks" and save the number 0 in it
    ☑️ write an "if" statement that checks the value of "numOfWeeks" is a "number" type
    ☑️ inside the "if" block, convert weeks to a boolean and save into var "areNoWeeks"
    ☑️ outside the "if" block, print the value of "areNoWeeks" -- what is it?
    ☑️ can you fix this so "areNoWeeks" prints out a boolean?
