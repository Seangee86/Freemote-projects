 Hey! Start in index.html if you haven't already... I'll wait...
 Ok let's get started -- again you'll want to open the Chrome console to test your results
*/

/*
    ☑️ Start by declaring an "Array literal" -- 
       that is, writing out an array from scratch! --
       and call the variable "nums"

    ☑️ Fill it with the numbers 1, 2, and 3
    ☑️ Now print the first number, and the last number from 'nums' to the console
    ☑️ Finally, change the "zero index" number to be 4
    ☑️ And print out the entire "nums array"
*/

/*
    ☑️ Let's add 5 and 6 to the end of the nums array (HINT: use a "method")
        Print nums to make sure everything looks right (should be [4, 2, 3, 5, 6])
    ☑️ Now let's set the "last index" number to be 10
    ☑️ And let's "pop" off the last number and store it in a variable "lastNum"
    ☑️ Then print "lastNum" to the console!
*/

/*
    ☑️ Let's declare an "Object literal" called "product" with properties for:
        > name, set to "shiny shoes"
        > brand, set to "gucci"
        > price, set to 100
        > color, set to "black"
        > soldOut, set to false

    ☑️ Let's print the name, brand, and price to the console in a single string
    ☑️ Let's add a new property / key called "sale" and set it to true
    ☑️ Let's add a new property called "tags" and set it to an array literal with
       values "men", and "luxury"
    ☑️ Let's change the soldOut property to true (don't change the original object)
    ☑️ Print out the entire object and make sure everything looks correct
