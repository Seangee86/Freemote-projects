    <!-- for this one, let's write some JS code directly inside our HTML -->
    <!-- Start by creating a script tag... -->
    <script>
        const myFistName = 'Sean';
        const myAge = 34;
        const myFullName = myFistName + ' Gee';

        console.log(`hi there my name is ${myFullName} and I am ${myAge}`)

        if (myAge > 28) {
            console.log('Im older than Aaron')
        } else if (myAge === 28) {
            console.log('Im the same age as Aaron')
        } else {
            console.log('Im youger than Aaron')
        }

        const isEven = myAge % 2 === 0;

        if (isEven) {
            console.log('My age is even')
        } else {
            console.log('My age is odd')
        }

        const activeUserCount = 4;
        const noUsers = 0;

        if (activeUserCount < 1) {
            console.log(`There are ${noUsers} active users`);
        } else if (activeUserCount > 1) {
            console.log(`There are ${activeUserCount} active users`);
        } else console.log(`There is ${activeUserCount} active user`);



        // const num = 1;
        // const lastDigit = i % 10; // teen numbers

        // if (num > 10 && num < 20) {
        //     console.log(`${num}th`)
        // } else if ()

        const num = 1;
        const lastDigit = num % 10; // teen numbers

        if (num > 10 && num < 20) {

        } else if (lastDigit === 2) {
            console.log(`${num}nd`)
        } else if (lastDigit === 3) {
            console.log(`${num}rd`)

        }

    <!-- 
        Now, let's write some code inside
        (And remember you can test variable values at any time by using console.log, 
         and then opening the browser -- even the best developers still do this!)
            ☑️ Create a string variable "myFirstName" with your first name inside
            ☑️ Create a number variable "myAge" with your age inside
    -->

    <!--
        ☑️ Now, create a new variable called "myFullName" USING the "myFirstName" variable
        ☑️ Print a statement introducing yourself
    -->

    <!-- 
        ☑️ Let's next write an if statement that prints 
            > "Im older than Aaron" if you're older than 28
            > "Im the same age as Aaron" if you ARE 28
            > Otherwise it should print "Im younger than Aaron"
    -->

    <!-- 
        ☑️ Next, calculate whether your age is even or odd, and store it in a boolean variable "isEven"
        ☑️ Now write another if statement that prints "My age is even", or "My age is odd", 
          depending which is true
     -->

    <!-- 
        YOUR CODE SHOULD NOW PRINT 3 SENTENCES TO THE CONSOLE:
        ☑️ Your introduction with name and age
        ☑️ A sentence saying whether you are older or younger than me
        ☑️ A sentence saying whether your age is even or odd
     -->

    <!-- 
        LET'S GET A BIT MORE CHALLENGING
        This is a real common use case to create different strings

        ☑️ Declare 2 variables, "activeUserCount" and set its value to 1
        ☑️ Now, write some code to print a formatted string like so: 
            ex. "There is 1 active user"
        ☑️ Change "activeUserCount" to be 2, and run the code again. 
            it should say "There is 2 active user" -- which is not ideal
        ☑️ Let's write an if statement to handle either 1, or more users, so...
            -> if there's one user it should say "There IS 1 active USER"
            -> if there's 0 or more than 1: "There ARE 2 active USERS"
            -> (note the difference)
     -->

    <!-- 
        AND THE FINAL CHALLENGE (HARD)
        Let's bring the previous example to a more difficult level
        
        ☑️ Given a number, write its ordinal case 
            ex. 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th
        ☑️ Use if / else if / else to accomplish this
        ☑️ Your code should work for any different number
